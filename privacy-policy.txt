In a Chrome extension, permissions must be declared in the manifest file, and they inform the browser what the extension has access to. The `activeTab`, `scripting`, and `storage` permissions have specific uses:

1. `activeTab`: This permission gives temporary access to the currently active tab when the user interacts with the extension's browser action (like clicking on the extension's icon in the toolbar). This is a more secure and privacy-friendly way to request tab access compared to the `tabs` permission, which provides access to all the user's tabs. In this extention switching extension, you need this permission to know which tab to apply or remove the grayscale filter from.

2. `scripting`: This permission allows the extension to programmatically inject scripts or CSS into webpages. In this extention, this permission to inject CSS that applies a grayscale filter to the current page, or to remove that CSS when the grayscale mode is turned off.

3. `storage`: This permission allows the extension to use the chrome.storage API to store, retrieve, and track changes to user data. Currently no data is collected.

Each of these permissions enables important functionality in your grayscale mode switching extension, and they all do so in a way that respects the user's privacy by requesting only the minimum necessary access to the user's data and browsing activity.

These permissions are required for extention to function properly and no user data is collected,stored,analysed by maker of this extention
